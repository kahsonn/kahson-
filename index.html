        <h1>Our Issue: Mental Health Misinformation</h1>
        <p> My issue with mentel health is that it can haunt you and make it seem like your fighting demons and it can be very depresssing . And could make a person go
            thrue so much in a short amount of time or even a long time .      
        Our whole group animation is about the dangers of spreading misinformationand how effactive it can be  What happens is our main character watches a show
        in which bad representation of people with Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is shown. She then goes to tell her friend about
        this adding her own interpretation of it which results in more misinformation being spread. That friend is coincidentally part of a big podcast which millions
        of people listen to. While talking about it, they add their own assumptions that are also wrong about the community.
       Now alot of peeople in the world know about a situation but just got the wrong situation . 
        Now let's say just one of those people goes and tells this to all of their friends? This is how a very hurtful cycle is born.</p>
